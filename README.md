## Sparkio Referral Platform

Sparkio is a two-sided referral and payout platform with dedicated experiences for members and administrators. The stack combines a stateless PHP REST API, a MySQL backend, and a modern Next.js (TypeScript) frontend styled with Tailwind and shadcn/ui components.

### Features
- **Members**
  - JWT authenticated dashboard with wallet metrics, referral analytics, and leaderboards.
  - Full referral history with filtering and withdrawal requests to UPI accounts.
- **Administrators**
  - Global KPI dashboard covering users, payouts, and earnings.
  - Referral review workflow with status updates and automatic wallet crediting.
  - Withdrawal processing queue and ads inventory management.
- **Security**
  - JWT-based stateless auth, HttpOnly cookies, and Next.js middleware for route protection.
  - Simple rate-limiting middleware guarding auth endpoints.
  - Environment-driven CORS, secrets, and database configuration.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, React Query.
- **Backend:** PHP 8 (PDO, JWT utilities), modular REST endpoints.
- **Database:** MySQL with InnoDB, utf8mb4 collation, referential integrity.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js ≥ 18
- npm ≥ 9
- PHP ≥ 8.1 with PDO extensions
- MySQL ≥ 8.0

### 1. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables
Copy the provided template and adjust for your environment:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Populate `.env` with values that match the way you are hosting the PHP API. For a default XAMPP setup (Apache serving the `sparkio` folder), use:
```
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=sparkio
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=

JWT_SECRET=replace-with-32-char-secret

FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost/sparkio
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost/sparkio
```

If you prefer PHP’s built-in server instead of Apache, set the API URLs to `http://localhost:8080` (or whichever host/port you bind to).

> The `.env` file is shared by both the PHP API and the Next.js frontend.

### 3. Prepare the database
Create the database and tables:
```bash
mysql -u <user> -p -e "CREATE DATABASE sparkio CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
mysql -u <user> -p sparkio < sql/schema.sql
mysql -u <user> -p sparkio < sql/seed.sql
```

The seed creates an initial admin user:
- **Email:** `admin@sparkio.app`
- **Password:** `Admin@123`

### 4. Run the PHP API
Serve the API directory with Apache/XAMPP (preferred for Windows) or PHP's built-in server.

- **XAMPP/Apache:** ensure the document root has the project under `/sparkio` so that `http://localhost/sparkio/api/...` resolves.
- **Built-in server (alternative):**
  ```bash
  php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 -t api
  ```

Ensure the URL you serve from matches the values in `.env` (`API_BASE_URL` & `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`).

### 5. Run the Next.js frontend
```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

## Project Structure
```
api/                 # PHP REST endpoints, middleware, and utilities
app/                 # Next.js App Router pages (auth, member, admin)
src/components/      # Shared React components & providers
src/services/        # Server-side data fetchers
sql/                 # Database schema and seed scripts
middleware.ts        # Next.js route protection
env.example          # Environment variable template
```

---

## Testing & Linting
- **Linting:** `npm run lint`
- **Type checking:** handled automatically by Next.js during build.

_Automated tests are not yet implemented; perform manual QA on key flows (auth, referrals, withdrawals) after changes._

---

## Deployment Notes
- Use HTTPS in production to protect JWT cookies (`NODE_ENV=production` enforces `secure` cookies).
- Store secrets (database credentials, JWT secret) in a vault or environment manager.
- Run the PHP API behind a hardened web server (nginx/Apache) and place it on the same private network as MySQL.
- Consider queueing (e.g., RabbitMQ) for withdrawal processing if payouts become long-running.
- Enable full-featured rate limiting (Redis, Cloudflare Turnstile, etc.) before going live.

## API Overview
Key endpoints (all JSON):

| Method | Endpoint                             | Description                          |
|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/auth/register.php`             | Register member (optional referral)  |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login.php`                | Login and receive JWT                |
| GET    | `/api/auth/me.php`                   | Fetch current user profile           |
| GET    | `/api/member/dashboard.php`          | Member analytics & wallet            |
| POST   | `/api/member/withdraw.php`           | Submit withdrawal request            |
| GET    | `/api/admin/dashboard.php`           | Admin metrics overview               |
| PUT    | `/api/admin/referrals/update.php`    | Approve / reject referral            |
| PUT    | `/api/admin/withdrawals/process.php` | Process withdrawal                   |
| GET    | `/api/public/ads.php`                | Public ad placements (filters)       |

All protected routes require the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

## Troubleshooting
- **401/redirect loops:** Ensure the PHP API is running and `API_BASE_URL` matches the served address.
- **CORS errors:** Confirm `FRONTEND_ORIGIN` aligns with the frontend URL.
- **Rate limit (429):** Auth endpoints allow 10 login attempts/minute and 5 registrations per 5 minutes by IP.
- **Empty dashboards:** Verify the database has referral data; seed or create users to populate stats.

Sparkio is designed for extendability—feel free to adapt the data model, swap UPI handling for alternative payment rails, or layer additional analytics as needed.
